### math_func_jit
# uses a pseudo-jit method to evaluate mathematical functions

The method incurrs a great deal of overhead in proccesses and files. This overhead could be somewhat reduced, or be worthwhile, 
if the functions could be compiled in large batches. Or if the compilation could be done at non-time-sensistive times.
Software like https://github.com/BitFunnel/NativeJIT would also greatly speed up the process.
